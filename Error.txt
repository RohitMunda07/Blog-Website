To summarize what we fixed:

1. Field naming consistency - Making sure we used "featuredimage" (lowercase) consistently throughout your code, matching your Appwrite database structure
2. Image display - Correctly implementing the getFilePreview method in your AppwriteService class
3. Error handling - Adding proper fallback for missing images and preventing infinite error loop
